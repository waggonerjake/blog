description: Details on how I made my garage workbench
---

Shortly after moving into home, I came to the realization I needed a workbench now given all the tools I have and all the stuff I have been building. Initially, I was thinking about just buying one but I ended making one myself so I could use up all the available space I had.

For starters, I am mostly happy with this workbench, it gets the job done. However, the bench top should probably be replaced. As of now, it is just 4 2x8s cut to length and equal width which would be fine except the boards I got were not very good quality and are warped thus leading to a non-flat bench top. I think if (when?) I redo the top I will just replace it with 3/4" plywood instead.

## Inspiration

Below are the two videos I use as inspiration for this build:

- [Firewood for Life - Workbench Build](https://youtu.be/CnQ53Agu2qY?si=doywOHZQKMXvSAw0)
- [The Honest Carpenter - Workbench Build](https://youtu.be/00Q2vQZFbu4?si=H0lJA56PjdU92C_O)

I mainly followed the video from **Firewood For Life** but I implemented some things from **The Honest Carpenter**'s build as well as made some modifications of my own.

## Materials & Assembly

My space for the workbench allows for a 6ft long by 2ft deep workbench. For the height, I made it about waist high on me which is give or take 3ft. Altogether, I used 2x4s for the length-long stretchers and top supports for the bench top to be screwed to. I used 4x4s for the legs. I cut dados into the 4x4s for the stretchers to sit in and then secured them to the legs using lag screws. For the width long stretchers, I used 4x4 as I had enough left over to put them to use, except for the very top where I used 2x4 still. For the shelves, I used fence pickets as the base and just cut them down to length. For the shelf supports, I ripped a 2x4 down into 1x2s and attached them to the 2x4 stretchers. I then used my brad nailer to secure the fence picket base to the supports.

This is what It looked like after all that was done:

You do not have to nail down the shelf base to the supports as they are pretty snug but I had the nails so I figured I might as well. In the video I watched, it was said to use deck boards for the shelves but they were just too expensive so I opted for fence pickets instead. For the top, I used 4 2x8s.

## Deviations from the videos

As mentioned, I mainly used the **Firewood For Life** video as my reference, but I really like the idea of having the extra shelf in there for quick access to tools while using the bench instead of taking up the bench top. I also opted out of putting in the middle leg. I felt this was unnecessary as my bench is only 6ft long so the middle leg was just overkill and would cost me valuable, continuous space. In **The Honest Carpenter** video, he recommends to use a solid core door as the top however those are just too expensive and too thick for my liking. I think I would rather just use a sheet of sanded plywood.

## Improvements

This was the initial finished workbench, taken right after I finished building it:

You can really see how bad the boards are warped here. This is the biggest improvement I can make to this bench as of now. If you compare my first picture at the beginning of the post, you can see I added some small bracket to the top stretcher. This connects the top board to the stretcher to give it some extra support. It has quite a bit of overhang (half its width) so it started to tip if I added too much weight to the end. Once again, if I used plywood this would not happen (I would keep the brackets most likely as they add a nice look to it though).

Another improvement you could do is sand the fence pickets prior to assembly. These pickets are pressure treated and have a strange texture/residue to them and make it unpleasant to touch. This is great for added friction so tools do not roll or slide but it can also be annoying to get it on your hands.
