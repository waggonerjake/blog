description: A simple jig to help cut straight with a circular saw
---

Before I had a miter saw, most of my cross cuts were made using my circular saw. For pieces similar width to a 2x4, I could use my speed square as a guide. However, for larger pieces this would not work. Therefore, I searched for a way to cut straight and found a pretty simple jig to make using leftover 1/4" ply and some wood glue.

## Inspiration

The below video was the inspiration for this jig. The jig in question is towards the end of the video. Please check it out to get a clear visual on how this jig works.

## Build

To make this you need some 1/4in plywood and wood glue. The plywood needs to be around 3x the width of your circular saw base. Rip down a small section of the plywood (~4in wide) then glue it in the center of the left over plywood and be sure to clamp it down. With it glued and clamped, set the front of your circular saw base so its up against the front end of the glued piece, like a fence. Then, make a cut all the down the plywood with your saw touching the glued fence the entire way. This will rip the plywood down to the exact width of your circular saw base + blade kerf. On the other side of the fence, do the same thing but face your circular saw the same direction so it uses the other side of the base. This will create 1 wide side and 1 thin side. This can be used to cut piece using either side of the saw.

I made my jig about 2ft long as its most helpful for cutting larger panels or boards.

## Tips

My circular saw's motor gets in the way a lot so making the fence extra wide allows for my clamps to have enough space to hold the jig down without the motor hitting them. So do a dry fit before gluing to make sure your clamps have room to hold the jig down.

This can be used to cut 2x4s as well even if its long like mine. The easiest way is to use another 2x4 behind your workpiece for the jig to sit on and add a clamp there. This way its the same height and makes it feel like 1 long board.

When making cuts with this jig, you want the start of the jig to be flush with the start of your workpiece. Trying to start in the middle of the jig but at the beginning of the workpiece just does not work well.

If you do not have a table saw to rip down the plywood to get your fence, you can use the factory edge and just try your best to free hand the cut. This will produce a fence with 1 side that should be straight. For the other side, do the same thing but on the other factory edge side. Now you will have two fences and you can just glue them both down but leave a small gap between them so they arent touching each other.
