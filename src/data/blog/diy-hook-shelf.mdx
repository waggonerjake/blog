Let's go into detail about a quick, simple, and effective hook shelf I made for our entryway.

## Materials
I had a piece of scrap wood laying around from a previous shelf project. Back when we lived in an apartment, we bought a 2' x 4' handipanel
from Menards and cut a few shelves out of it: 2 Rectangle and 2 Triangle shelves. We then stained them with some left over stain we had from
our dining room table we refinished. Both triangles and 1 of the rectangles were already hung up, but we never got around to hanging this last
one up, so I decided to give it a second life and make a slightly more advanced shelf.

This piece of wood started off 18" x 9.5", so it was already a good size for the space I was filling. I had to buy the 4 hooks for the shelf
but that's it, I already had everything else I needed at home. I used wood glue and brad nails to build the shelf itself, and then attached it
to the wall using a keyhole router bit, screws, and wall anchors.

## Inspiration
At first I was considering just buying a shelf from Amazon instead of building it, but the ones that had the design I wanted were more expensive
than I thought they'd be. So I figured I might as well just build one myself, especially since I already had a piece of finished wood lying around.
I decided we needed this shelf because we did not have any place to put our diaper bag by the door, and thus it was always in the way.

The image above was a shelf I saw on Amazon, which can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/HRONRAD-Farmhouse-Entryway-Bathroom-Kitchen/dp/B0D358PL7J?crid=3LXNLX3Q5NHMH&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.uepiXLcjMY-z8FZ9mVtJbWAZdRWLARfxQlQ5OL-i2bYnK9WKwUh9E2q9OvXwSDHLf5WMrBns-MwK9eHVlqu7XttsnF2LXGqmscOedjmr0-HSVilZHP7xtrDhivoatRBMtrLjVxTigXzTcoUF-BR_QUCdiHBiL3Rm40AqMmwDOR8jz-A9R9WG3IiEcP8z9W0nHlSHVmoQVcInzRQQHoxUQFlc00b8WZgVAjFkqi6UoB9Z29Gfgmr2qApaEYb76tmrG9R5Xh_VGijuaPiXu5PAoGAeArirg4p1hNaiHq2qPSU.gWmOqHexhcOasBMvJ6Cf_jxJDqO2CtixtPNVQaJfrZw&dib_tag=se&keywords=wall%2Bhook%2Bshelf&qid=1753558029&sprefix=hook%2Bshelf%2Caps%2C143&sr=8-44&th=1).
You may notice my shelf looks a little different than the picture above. This is because I did not have enough wood to make the back go all
the way up and have enough spacing for the hooks. Therefore, I had to compromise with a butt joint at the top instead of a dado, which in my opinion looks just as good.

## Build Process
To build this shelf, I had to make a 2 cuts. 
  - 1: 3.5" rip cut for the shelf itself. 
  - 1: 1" rip cut on the board to use as the shelf ledge.
  - Leftover: Used as the shelf back where the hooks would sit. 
  
I then glued the shelf to the top of the back piece as a butt joint, clamped it down, and shot some brad nails (1.25" brads) in it. Then once that was dry, I did the same thing with the shelf and the edge piece. All that
was left was to use my router to make the two keyholes on the back of the shelf and then the build was finished! Overall, this project took about 3 hours, which include dry time for the glue.


## Hanging
To hang this up, I used a [keyhole hanging kit](https://www.menards.com/main/hardware/picture-mirror-hanging-hardware/hangman-products-reg-100lb-steel-key-hole-hanging-kit/khl/p-1444432032501-c-13085.htm?exp=false) to mark where the drywall anchors need to go. You simply
put the metal indicators in the keyholes, tape them so they dont move, then hold your workpiece up where you want it to sit and push it in the wall. The indicators are pointy so they leave a little
indent in the wall for you to know where to put your screws/anchors. Just be sure to use a level to make sure its lined up!

I used 2 heavy duty drywall anchors (~70Lbs rated) to put the screws in the wall and then just slid the shelf down to complete the process.

## Improvements
A couple things could be improved with how this was done

### Cut Keyholes before assembly
Since I cut the keyholes after the shelf was already assembled, I had to use some scrap wood to prop the shelf up while making the keyholes.
If I cut the keyholes before i assembled the shelf, then it would have just been on a flat piece of wood and would have been easier to do.

### Cut the shelf edge first
Since the shelf was already stained (and I did not want to stain again), doing the rip cuts can show some unstained sides since it does not
penetrate all the way down. When I made the rip cuts, I cut the 3.5" shelf first, so 5/6 sides were stained. So when I cut the edge piece,
only 4/6 sides were stained. This left the top of the shelf unstained, which is fine for this because its so high up but for other shelves
this would be unsightly. Therefore, if I could do it again I would cut the 1" edge piece first and then the shelf piece.
