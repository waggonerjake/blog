description: How I store my miter saw when not in use
---

I got a miter saw as my very first father's day gift as I have been wanting one for quite some time. The main reason I did not get one sooner is because I had to place to store it. As you can see from [my post about my workbench](/posts/workbench), its not _that_ big and I do not have a substantial amount of storage under it either. I did not want to put the saw on the table top or on the ground, so I just never ended up buying one. However, this changed once I figured out a way to store it.

## My Miter Saw

I got the Metabo HPT 10in Compound miter saw, which you can find [here on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Metabo-HPT-C10FCGS-Compound-15-Amp/dp/B07PX44JQM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=34KQVYHMB5B94&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qe0-kpxBPM1qAXpxq32Y-Znch1ap7KnsNCSILaZMv5nDtRbBfUI5IhE6666s-IbRyXhJURUvspW10qCkrvQBF__w3Sn8SmYvwKJZ7Kg7JlTL9Fijp1lS3zj5F-SuZ-uQXdkqQmveakuDVxjxDvMYbNBIiKMWYSPFJDuNuRAFBLApYIA0YT-VuGV_5J3mjlf_0eYJqbu9VzZOY3ZTbHB0oPtIIHOdY38VbIbXTZwsn_V7CHNoXk_7qkl-KiN9whNHkZ6vIz6V6bPuNcMSf00fNFnj3E0FHkkGvMEXCXi_jas.FmP1PO55GRKmS1XHYaNHdmZijH9bOFJS5vXzWsKBVVc&dib_tag=se&keywords=metabo%2Bmiter%2Bsaw&qid=1755229383&sprefix=metabo%2Bmiter%2Bsa%2Caps%2C210&sr=8-1&th=1). The main reasons I bought this saw are as follows:

- Low cost
- Lightweight (~25 LBS)
- 10in blade
- Compact

In a perfect world, I would buy a dual bevel, sliding 10in miter saw with either a laser or LED shadow line. But due to my size limitation discussed later, I could not.

## Storage Problem

Miter saws take up a good chunk of space and since my shop is just my garage, space is quite valuable. I did not want the saw to sit on the garage floor or on my workbench table top, mainly due to potential water damage and usability of my table. My workbench's bottom shelf is not tall enough to properly store a miter saw too, even with it folded down. I did not have any shelves or anywhere else to store this saw until I came up with the idea of building a table-like structure.

## Storage Solution

To solve my storage problem, I utilized some dead space in the corner of my garage between the interior wall and a cabinet by the garage fridge. This area ended up being about 4 sq ft which was the perfect size for my miter saw. And since it was not restricted by height, it was a prime location for this saw to sit. The 3 main issues with this space were that 1.) there was a receptacle and a light switch right where I wanted it to sit, 2.) I have stuff on the floor that I did not want to be moved (e.g. folding tables and chairs), and 3.) The cabinet acts as an obstacle that I would not drilling into, so I essentially only have 2 walls to work with.

My original thought was to put 1 2x4 on each wall to make an L and then try and attach a top to it. However, this would not work since I would not have any support on the outer corner. Therefore, I did a modified version where I attached a 1 2x4 to the left wall to act as a cleat and then I built some legs and a stretcher to act as a support on the right side. With both sides supported, I connected them using 2 pieces of scrap plywood. This created a table-like structure that you can see below:

/>

The cleat on the wall is attached using heavy duty drywall anchors (rated for 70lbs). I could not use the studs as there was a nail plate (due to the receptacle) where I wanted to attach this. Since this miter saw weighs less than 25lbs, this is more than enough to hold this. For the right side, the legs go all the way to the bottom and the plywood is screwed into 1 leg and stretcher. For the left side, the plywood is also screwed into the cleat.

Building the storage like this allows for a couple things:

- I can keep storing my items underneath it like it was before
- Dead space is utilized more effectively than before
- I can put other lightweight items (like miter saw accessories) on the table too

## Improvements

If I had to build this again, I would move the stretcher on the right side to sit on top of the legs rather than in between them, acting more like a top plate. I believe this would distribute the load better to the wood rather than to the screws.
