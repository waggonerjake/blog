description: Comparing shopping at Menards vs Lowe's
---

Shopping for home improvements items can be pretty daunting when there are so many options for everything, from door knobs to furniture to the stores themselves. I live in the Midwest and thus the two big stores near me are Lowe's and Menards, so let's take a look at what each store does best and what they do poorly.

## Mobile App

Both stores have a mobile app and each of these have some distinct features that make them stand out. Let's take a look at some of their features:

| Feature                        | Lowe's                                                                    | Menards                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Store Map_**                | Does not include a store map                                              | Includes a map and shows where an item is ✅             |
| **_Item Location_**            | Shows the item location with Aisle and Bay                                | Shows the item location with Aisle and Section           |
| **_Search Filtering/Sorting_** | Strong search feature, including good filters and sorting ✅              | Basic searching, filters and sorting could use some work |
| **_User Reviews_**             | Contains product reviews from other users                                 | Has no product reviews ❌                                |
| **_Advanced Features_**        | Visual search, Chat, Store Mode, Barcode scanning, good fractional search | Barcode scanning, Buying Guides, Weekly flyer viewing    |

Overall, both apps are pretty solid. However, historically I have had better luck finding what I am looking for using the Lowe's app. The comprehensive search features, like the strong sorting/filtering capabilities and fractional search (e.g. searching for 3/4 plywood), and the isle numbers have helped a ton. Menards' store map has come in handy multiple times though and I wish Lowe's had this feature. If Menards improved their search feature to include more sorting and filtering options, I would give them the edge.

**Winner: Lowe's**

## Selection and Success Rate

With both of these stores being massive in size, there are thousands of items sold in each. Let's compare the two stores in terms of overall variety and whether or not they have what I was looking for:

### Selection

For overall selection, Menards is the gold standard from my experience. Not only does Menards have a lumber yard, a garden center, electrical, paint, plumbing, hardware, kitchen, etc., they also have a small grocery section. I can buy a gallon of milk, a gallon of paint, a sheet of plywood, and a fridge from the same store. Menards also has a _very_ good selection of fasteners that range in all shapes, sizes, and types. Menards does not have a lot of brand variety when it comes to tools, but they seem to have any type of tool you would need. Menards also shines in its lumber selection, specifically its handipanels and boards. I can buy different size and species of handipanels at Menards that I did not even know existed.

Lowe's lacks in its variety of fasteners and lumber when compared to Menards for the most part. Lowe's does shine in the plywood section as I have had a better time getting thin sheets of plywood at Lowe's than I have at Menards. Lowe's also has a much stronger variety of tool brands than Menards does. For instance, when searching for a power drill Lowe's comes up with brands like Dewalt, Kobalt, Craftsman, and Skil whereas Menards comes up with Tool Shop, MasterForce, Black & Decker, and North Tech. Another place Lowe's seems to lack in the variety category is the lighting section. When looking for a ceiling fan, Lowe's only had about 15 options whereas Menards had about 25.

**Winner: Menards**

### Success Rate

There is nothing worse than going to the store only to find out they do not have what you are looking for. This is what I am referring to as success rate.

Due to the sheer variety Menards has, they _typically_ have what I am looking for. Again, Menards shines in their boards and lumber and their fasteners departments. If I need a special type of board (e.g. quality pine, oak veneer panel, etc.) or a very specific fastener then Menards is my go-to because I know they will have it. Due to Menards not so great search feature on their app, sometimes it is hard to find items and thus I switch over to Lowe's and find it there, so that definitely does not help their success rate. Overall, Menards' success rate is pretty high in my experience unless im looking for a specific brand of item or the search feature doesn't show me what im looking for (e.g. 1/4in plywood).

Lowe's search feature really allows you to find exactly what you are looking, assuming they have it. However, with Lowe's is lacking in their fastener choices and specific lumber and thus they are a no-go for that. For every day items, they are wonderful and typically have what you are looking for. Lowe's makes it really easy to find what you want and that makes the overall experience so much better.

Taking variety out of the equation, both stores are strong in their success rate so this is a tie.

**Winner: Tie**

## Pricing

Menards has their Rebate program going on for most of the year and that can make things cheaper, however most people do not do this as you have to go through the hassle of mailing it in. The app tries to trick you by listing the rebate price instead of the actual list price and so you may think you are getting it cheaper than you actually are. Due to Menards' brands they sell, most of the time the items will be cheaper than what you can find at Lowe's but they may be a tradeoff with the quality. However, I have used brands like ToolShop from Menards and have had great success with them at a fraction of the cost for the same thing I can get at Lowe's. Overall, the pricing at Menards is pretty strong and similar to its competition but I would say for the most part it is cheaper due to the rebate program and the lack of name brand.

Lowe's does not have a rebate program like Menards, but they do have a rewards program that can offer deals and discounts. Lowe's also shows you the price you pay up front, which is not as deceitful as Menards. When comparing 8' 2x4 prices, Lowe's had them at 13 cents higher than what you would find at Menards, and that's before the rebate. with Lowe's, you pay a premium for brands like Dewalt due to their reputation and thus you expect to pay more than something from Menards' MasterForce brand.

If you are looking for the cheapest items, Menards is your go-to.

**Winner: Menards**

## Overall shopping experience

Personally, I enjoy shopping at Menards more than Lowe's. Menards has music playing and has their little jingle going off every once in a while and it just feels more put together in there. Menards feels brighter than Lowe's and thus it doesn't feel so drab. Lowe's has a very distinct smell as well that is a mix between fertilizer and concrete that is just unpleasant too. Where Menards' shopping experience drops a bit for me is how their lumber yard and ordering is setup. Menards has a massive outdoor lumber yard that is protected by a gate that requires you to scan an order barcode to get in. This means that I cannot drive back there and load up unless I have already paid for the lumber. However, the available lumber, especially dimensional lumber, can be wonky and warped. Therefore, If I want to be sure I am getting quality boards, I either have to go back there on foot and load up a cart and check out or walk back, verify it looks good, order them, drive back there and pick it up. This system really needs to be re-worked to allow me to drive back there and pick out the wood before purchasing it. Menards also has no user reviews which makes buying things online risky.

Lowe's biggest selling point and the main reason I go there is because they have an indoor lumber yard. I can get 8ft 2x4s inside the store rather than going outside and walking a far distance. I can simply load the flatbed cart from within the comfort of the store and check out at the lumber cashier and well it out to my car. This allows me to get the quality lumber I want without having to go through the hassle of going all the way outside to load it assuming they have acceptable pieces. This is where Lowe's shines in terms of shopping experience. If I need to get any lumber that is outside at Menards, I first check if Lowe's has it and if they do, I buy it there instead. Lowe's also has user reviews which makes buying things online feel safer as you can see what others have said or ask questions. This makes a huge difference for people that buy online-only items.

This lumber buying experience is such a big deal to me and the user reviews for online shopping, I have to give this Lowe's.
