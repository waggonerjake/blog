description: A pattern of terrible timing when it comes to life events and owning a home
---

Owning a home definitely comes with it perks and I am extremely lucky to be able to be a homeowner at my age, however things always seem to break at the worst possible time. As the old saying goes: _when it rains, it pours_

## Synopsis

It seems whenever I have a big event going on or something expensive planned, another event happens immediately after that was unplanned. Below I state some examples of this happening, some are more worse than others but everything ended up working out in the end. That is what im most grateful for. My wife and I have built ourselves a serious security blanket for unplanned events and thankfully its never been truly terrible. However, the repeated pattern of terrible timing is just ridiculous. It hasn't always been like this, it only started happening once we bought our house. Goes to show being a home owner isn't always the most fun and definitely not the cheapest thing. It definitely helps to look at the age of the major systems in your home before buying and plan ahead for future repairs/replacements. When we bought our home, this was the age of our systems:

- AC: 20 years old (2002)
- Water Heater: 10 years old (2012)\* | Originally, our home inspector said it was from 2017 but upon further inspection that was incorrect
- Water Softener: 11 years old (2011)
- Oven: 10 years old (2012)

## Samp and Closing

This was the first of many events and it involves our cat, [Samp](https://www.jakewaggoner.com/posts/origin-of-samp), and the process of buying our house. We bought our first home in May 2023 and were able to put down a down payment that was > 5%. Our home buying journey only took us about 6 months but we weren't seriously looking until February. During sometime towards the end of April, Samp started acting strange one day and she kept throwing up. We assumed she had a hairball that she just couldn't get out and she'd be fine. However, as the days went on she was still acting strange and kept throwing up. She was not eating, was not playing, and just overall wasn't being herself.

She was less than a year old at the time but she never acted like this before. After a day or two she started throwing up bile and that's when we decided to take her to the vet. After multiple vet trips, x-rays, and 1 ER visit we came to know that she had swallowed a piece of foam from a litter mat. This became lodged in her intestine and was creating a blockage. At the ER, we talked to the surgeon and he was describing the surgery she needed and that it would cost about ~$8k. The timing of this couldn't have been worse as we had just paid our down payment on the house so our funds were pretty tight and the hospital did not have a payment plan available. We decided to put the vet bill on our credit card so it gave us a little more time to get the funds together without getting interest. Plus, my job offers pet insurance so once we hit the $750 deductible, we get 50% of the bill back. So really we only ended having to spend about $5k instead of $8k.

It was a huge range of emotions, on one hand we were excited to own our home, on the other we were stressed and anxious for our cat to get better and tight on cash. Due to our insurance and our safety net, we were able to come out of this without any additional debt or issues, and Samp has been doing great.

## Truck and AC

I personally have only ever owned 2 cars in my life. I owned a Hyundai Tiburon from 2017-2020 and a Ford F-150 from 2023+. My brother's ex-fiance totaled my Tiburon when she was driving it without permission, but they ended up paying me $1k for it. At the time, it was a over 13yrs old and had 130k miles, but it was still a solid little car. Due to covid, I was (and still am) able to work from home. Therefore, I did not feel the need to own a vehicle of my own from 2020-2023. My wife owned a car the entire time so we only had the 1 car for the two of us. This was fine for the most part but sometimes it became an issue. However, we were saving up to get my a truck once we bought our house and so we ended up being able to buy my truck in cash from Carvana.

We bought my truck in August of 2023 for a total of ~$27.5k. About 2 weeks after we bought the truck, our AC system started going out in our home. My brother is an HVAC tech and warned us that we should probably get a new system soon due to it being over 20 years old and full of bio-growth (mold). However, in early september we noticed that the air was not cooling and due to its age, parts are hard to come by. Therefore, we decided to get a whole new unit. Once again, we have a large planned expense and then a (somewhat) unplanned expense come up. Since my brother is a tech, we got a pretty significant discount on the new system, but it still ended up being about $13k. We did have a good amount saved for a new system as mentioned previously, however the timing of this was the real issue.

## Vacation and Water Softener

In March of 2025, my wife and I decided to go on our last vacation before our son was born, known as a "babymoon". About 4 days before we left for our trip, we noticed our water pressure in the house would drop substantially if we used more than 1 source at once. For instance, if one person was in the shower and the other used the toilet, the shower would lose about 90% of its pressure. We decided to have a plumber come by and diagnose the issue and turns out our super old water softener had failed and was causing the pressure issues. The plumber was able to diagnose the issue super easily and narrowed it down to the water softener. Luckily, water softeners are not very expensive but we did just pay for our vacation (flights, car rental, hotels, tickets, etc.) so this was just another extra expense we weren't planning for.

Even though the expense was unplanned, it wasn't that bad of a hit to the wallet and they were able to install it next day. It went as smooth as it could and its a much better system. Overall, this was the least stressful of all the events.

## NICU and Water Heater

My son was born in June of 2025 and was born at 41 weeks. We stayed in the maternity ward for 3 days then got unexpectedly moved to the NICU for a few days due to my son having feeding issues. Getting moved to the NICU was a very stressful experience at first as it was completely out of the blue and since this was our first kid, we were so unsure about everything. During our time in the hospital, I had my friend Aaron stop by the house each night to check on our cat Samp and feed her and fill up her water bowl. On Thursday night, the 2nd night in the NICU, Aaron sends me a video around 10pm of some water in the garage. Obviously, this was not supposed to be happening. I asked him to take some more videos so I could diagnose the issue over the phone and tell him what to do in the short term. He was able to identify that the water was coming from the water heater and I was able to guide him in turning the water off at the shutoff valve.

What is interesting is that my wife and I stopped by the house earlier that day to get more clothes, food, and take a shower. When we left we did not see any water or any sign of a leak in the garage, so it must've happened in that short span between when we left and when Aaron got there. I guess the shower we took killed the hot water heater and caused it to leak. Since there was an active leak, I decided to stay home that night instead of go back to the hospital and call the plumber in the morning. I was not optimistic about getting them out here because it was now a Friday morning. We were getting discharged from the NICU on Saturday and we could not turn the water on without the water heater leaking, so this needed to be fixed ASAP.

I called the plumber and they said they could come out Saturday morning, so I made sure I was home to meet them. I talked to the plumber and he said he would be able to put a 50-gallon tanked water heater in, that same day, for about $2.3k. This was an immediate yes for me and they installed it within 2 hours. I was super grateful they were able to do this so quickly and the price wasn't too bad. This whole experience was quite stressful as we were stuck in the NICU and had an active leak. On the bright side, the leak was in the garage and our son was doing well in the NICU, but again, the timing could not have been worse.
