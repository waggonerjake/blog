I want to show off the French cleat system I built for my tools in my garage. Before I had this, all my tools were thrown together in a toolbox or just laying around and thus they were quite hard to find. What always seemed to happen was the tool I needed was always at the bottom of the box, even though I used it the most recently. Eventually I got tired of this and decided it was time to organize.

## What and Why

A French cleat is a type of hanger that consists of two pieces, one attached to the wall and one attached to the work piece. To create a cleat, rip 2 same-width boards at a 45 degree (or if you have 1 board that is wide enough that works too). Attach one piece to the wall with the angle sloped downward towards the wall. Attach the other piece to the work piece with the angle facing upward towards the workpiece. The way these cleats work is by sliding the two angles into each other thus forming 1 unified board. Below is a picture showing what a pair of cleats look like.

I decided to go with french cleats instead of something like peg board or regular shelves for a couple reasons.

1.  Cheaper: Peg board can get really expensive especially for all the accessories
2.  Moveability: Cleats are not fastened or glued down, so I can move the workpiece around as needed to make room for other pieces
3.  Customizable: Since I make these all myself I can make the tool holder to fit my specific needs

## My Setup

My shop is just 1/4 0f my garage and thus its quite small. I have learned to utilize vertical space as much as possible and thus doing a French cleat wall felt perfect for my scenario. Before building this, I watched a couple YouTube videos with [this one](https://youtu.be/ME4R-TjIkcY?si=efd9gWc-Rik3kOnq) being my favorite.

At the top of this post you can see a picture of my French cleat wall. I have a good amount of holders created for various tools and so far it has really improved the quality of life having these tools easily available and ready to be retrieved. Before showing off my holders, I need to point out an important detail with my wall. Prior to building this French cleat wall, I had an electrician install an outlet in the garage.

When he installed it, he used conduit across the drywall to house the wire and connect to the box. This meant the wall was not flat all the way down. With French cleat walls you need to have the cleats go out the same distance from the wall but due to this conduit I was unable to do that with my standard 3/4" thick cleats. To get around this, I ended up double stacking cleats together to get it to extend beyond the conduit and thus make each cleat (or pair of cleats in this case) extend the same distance out from the wall. I fastened the cleats to the wall studs using 2 3" long screws per stud. Below you can see a picture of what I am referring to.

  <figcaption class="text-center">Double Stacked Cleats</figcaption>
</figure>

As you can see, I have 1 cleat attached directly to the wall then another cleat attached to it, thus creating a double stack. One thing to note is that the back cleat could be any regular board, but when cutting my cleats I just used the other half of the board as the back cleat. Lastly, its important to note that the back cleat is bigger than the front. This is required so when the holders are attached to the front cleat they do not slide back. This essentially makes the back cleat act as a wall. The height difference is only about 1" but thats enough to cover the cleat angle.

## My French Cleat Holders

Below is a showcase of my current French cleat holders I have built. Some are an original design some are taken from various YouTube videos. Most of these are built with plywood, wood glue, and brad nails, but some use screws and other scrap wood I had laying around. A good rule of thumb when making these is it should go down at least as much as it goes out.

Also, most of my French cleats are cut to 1" but some are cut to 2". I use 1" for standard holders and 2" for heavy duty ones. By this, I mean when cutting my cleat I set my fence to be 1" (or 2") and thus the part that is attached to my work piece is either 1" or 2". Having more area gives me more glue surface and thus a stronger bond.

### Chisels

  <figcaption class="text-center">Chisel French Cleat Holder</figcaption>
</figure>

This was made by cutting slots into plywood just wide enough for the chisel neck. Ideally you would chamfer the edge but at the time I did not have a router.

### Combination Square

  />
  <figcaption class="text-center">

</figure>

This is just a little ledge to hold my combo square.

### Hammer and Mallet

  />
  <figcaption class="text-center">
    Hammer and Mallet French Cleat holder
  </figcaption>
</figure>

My claw hammer just sits directly on the cleats so that makes it easy. The mallet is just a back piece with holes drilled through for the side pieces to sit in, like a mortise and tenon to to an extent.

### Hanging Equipment

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/french-cleats/hang.jpg" alt="Hanging Equipment" />
  <figcaption class="text-center">
    Hanging Equipment French Cleat holder
  </figcaption>
</figure>

This is an original design for my tools I use whenever I need to hang things. This includes a stud finder, two small levels, hanger markers, a torpedo level, a small torpedo level, a laser level, and small hanging fasteners. I used dowels to hold up the stud finder and two torpedo levels. I use a ledge to hold the 2 small levels and 2 magnets to hold each of the hanger markers. I used a simple butt joint shelf for the laser level and a nail to hang my fasteners.

### Jigsaw

<figure>

    class="h-1/2 w-1/2 sm:h-1/4 sm:w-1/4"
  />
  <figcaption class="text-center">Jigsaw French Cleat holder</figcaption>
</figure>

This Jigsaw took 3 iterations to make, each being a different design. This one is great because it allows me to store my jigsaw blades with it. This is just a wooden box with a small hole drilled in the top for the currently loaded jigsaw blade to protrude through.

### Klein Tools

<figure>

    class="h-1/2 w-1/2 sm:h-1/4 sm:w-1/4"
  />
  <figcaption class="text-center">Klein Tools French Cleat holder</figcaption>
</figure>

This holds my Klein electrical tools as well as my angle finder. The angle finder sits on two L-brackets and since it has a magnetic base, its attached quite snug. The bag of klein tools just slides into a little box with an arm at the top to stop it from leaning.

### Knives

    class="h-1/2 w-1/2 sm:h-1/4 sm:w-1/4"
  />
  <figcaption class="text-center">Knives French Cleat holder</figcaption>
</figure>

This is just a simple box to hold my box knives and other various knives in.

### Small Screwdrivers

  <figcaption class="text-center">
    Small Screwdriver French Cleat holder
  </figcaption>
</figure>

This is a butt joint with holes cut in the bottom to allow for the screwdriver head to protrude through. I also added an edge to hold a hex key set.

### Pliers & Handled Items

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/french-cleats/pliers.jpg" alt="Pliers" />
  <figcaption class="text-center">Pliers French Cleat holder</figcaption>
</figure>

This uses a thin piece of plywood (1/4") to act as a holder for my pliers. The pliers site on it in between their handles and can lean against the back if needed. There is no bottom to allow for the handles to hang down as far as they need.

### Circular Saw

<ImageCarousel
  images={[
    "/assets/french-cleats/saw-left.jpg",
    "/assets/french-cleats/saw-right.jpg",
  ]}
/>

This is my most heavy duty and complex holder as of now. It holds the saw at an angle and has a slot cut in the base to allow the blade and blade guard to protrude through. I added a dowel to hold the arbor wrench. Its also one of the few I have made that uses screws.

### Screwdrivers

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/french-cleats/screw.jpg" alt="Screwdrivers" />
  <figcaption class="text-center">Screwdriver French Cleat holder</figcaption>
</figure>

This was the very first holder I made. Its similar to the other screwdriver one but it houses all my screwdriver bits too.

### Square

<figure>

    class="h-1/2 w-1/2 sm:h-1/4 sm:w-1/4"
  />
  <figcaption class="text-center">Square</figcaption>
</figure>

My speed square can just sit on the french cleat so I did not have to build a holder for it

### Tape Measure

<figure>
  <img
    src="/assets/french-cleats/tape.jpg"
    alt="Tape Measure"
    class="h-1/2 w-1/2 sm:h-1/4 sm:w-1/4"
  />
  <figcaption class="text-center">Tape Measure</figcaption>
</figure>

This holds both of my tape measures using a butt joint and some rails to hold them steady.
