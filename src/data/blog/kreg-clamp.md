description: How to use the Kreg Face Clamp
---

I got a Kreg pocket hole jig and it came with a clamp. At first I was unsure how to effectively use this clamp and so I just set it aside collecting dust. However, once I figured out how to properly use it it has quickly became one of my favorite clamps. This post will briefly describe how to use this clamp so you do not waste time like I did.

## Using the clamp

I will be referring to the picture above when talking about this clamp as that is what mine looks like. To open and un-clamp this clamp, squeeze the small handle into the large handle. It might be tough but once its completely depressed in there it will disengage the clamp and will allow you to move it freely. Next, twist the screw at the bottom of the fixed handle. Twisting it clockwise will allow you to move it closer together and twisting it counter-clockwise will move it farther away. To get a good fit, close the clamp by squeezing the handles together, this will lock the clamp down. Twist the screw until the locked clamp is slightly bigger than the workpiece you want to clamp down. Now, open the clamp again and twist the screw just a little (maybe like a half turn or 1 full turn) clockwise to get it tight. Now put the open clamp on your workpiece and squeeze the handles to clamp it down.

## Pocket Hole Jig

The pocket hole jig I got is the [320](https://www.amazon.com/Kreg-KPHJ320-22-Pocket-Hole-KHC-MICRO-Clamp/dp/B0B15KFCDW/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?crid=2LCZ202Y4DFM4&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ThFLza9fHy7cjOX6qwuNKE1fDQx5k3CwG1j46Fb3cSwk9W2ZVqcJx4vCtrO_Jh8BATsm4be34FtaSLvPv2q24b4LVEljaSsB8fGgvrT63z1KMI2JI_O1Pcz1xqWUMNo99bPwm0H-RWVmZ05RCxbDW6zRUG19y7gaW1TQse19q-3PCTU4xEcy8fbVjfJPpS-uRlfRDdbYZcaYrxFwbjiZz1wAK5rjxvZrt94SjAuuzsnPiQK2IzPd0V5aEHQgEJlh1gydMW4R5tJF63NeR4CBTxjFXANhzTXY_FBTGYMWiGA.jDO5pQxNZnMd5_WdpbbGYp0dYVh9gwMGBC8aKmkua7Q&dib_tag=se&keywords=pocket+hole+jig&qid=1754358815&sprefix=pocket+hole+jig%2Caps%2C125&sr=8-3-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1). It comes with a 2" face clamp and the pocket hole jig.
