Here I will explain the origin of my cat's name, Samp, as well as her background. You can see some pictures of Samp below :)

## Name Explanation

The name Samp originated as an accident when I was a child, somewhere between the ages of 8-12. There was (still is?) a game called [Webkinz](https://www.webkinz.com/) where you would buy a physical stuffed animal that you could
then connect to the game and let them live a life virtually. It was a really cool concept as a kid and it was super popular with my age group. When you got a new Webkinz stuffed animal, you had to register them with the game and do things like give them a name
and background. My first and I think only Webkinz I owned was a Bullfrog.

Being a child at the time, I was super excited to bring this Bullfrog to life in the virtual world. On the drive back home from the store, I was busy thinking of the perfect name for this thing and ended up choosing "Swamp" (He is a bullfrog so it makes perfect sense).
As soon as I got home I hopped on the computer and booted up Webkinz and started uploading my new friend to the game. The thing about Webkinz is the name is **immutable**, as in, once it has been set you are never allowed to change it again. This came back to haunt
me (maybe in a good way looking back at it?).

There I was typing away at the keyboard entering what I thought was the name "Swamp", I hit submit, agree that the name is correct, and boom, up on the screen it says "Welcome Samp". I was devastated as I knew I could not
fix the unfortunate typo, all while my mom and sister in the background thought it was the funniest thing. I ended up laughing about it as I knew there was nothing I could do, but to this day I swear I entered it in correctly...

That is where the name Samp comes from, a typo on the game Webkinz for a Bullfrog I wanted to name Swamp.

## Name Reasoning and Nicknames

If you have ever been around other cats, you know their names are often ridiculous (at least when compared to their canine counterparts). Keeping this in mind, we felt Samp was appropriate. When we adopted her, we wanted to give her a single syllable name so if she
was up to no good, we could yell her name quickly to get her attention. I was going back and forth on short names, like Bean, for a while during the wait to adopt her. While I was thinking of a name, my wife recommended Samp out of the blue and I immediately agreed.

Here are some nicknames we call her:

- Sampers
- Sampson
- Samperton

## Samp's Background

Samp was adopted shortly after my wife and I got married, literally a day or two after we got back from our honeymoon. We adopted her from the [Hamilton County Humane Society](https://www.hamiltonhumane.com/). We visited the humane society just to look around and
did not really have an intention of adopting a cat at that time. However, we visited the kitten room and Samp (at the time her name was Brioche) kept jumping and climbing all over me and I instaly fell in love. I have never owned a cat in my life, so this was a
big change for me. I kept looking at her once we left the room and felt like we had to get her, so I decided we should. I don't regret a thing, she has been a wonderful cat and everything I could have hoped for.
