description: A simple, 1-day outdoor bench build
---

My neighbor gave me some cedar he had left over from a pergola and I thus I had to decide what to do with it. First, I built an [outdoor coffee table](/posts/outdoor-table) and with what I had left over, I decided to build a bench for our front porch.

## Inspiration

I found the idea for this specific bench from a home improvement book my wife's ex-coworker's husband gave me. The book is titled **Big Book of Home How-To** and made by **Better Homes and Gardens**. Its a decently dated book but that actually comes in handy for the age of my house. It was published in 2003 and my home was built in 2002, so a lot of the stuff in the book is still extremely relevant. This particular build was on page 796. The book I have looks like the photo below.

I decided to do a bench build as we did not have any type of seating on our front porch. Its an uncovered small porch, but I still wanted something. I think in the long run a swing with an awning would be best but this will do for now.

## Materials and Build

I followed the book instructions for the most part, but I did make a few adjustments. To make this bench, I used 4x4 for the legs, 2x6 for the leg braces and the bench top, and 2x4 for the diagonal braces. The book says to use 2x4 for legs but I had 4x4 that needed to be used, so I swapped those out. I cut the legs to be 15.5in tall and spaced them out 16in, therefore the leg braces were cut to 16in. These were attached using outdoor deck screws. For the bench top, I cut the 2x6s to 4ft long and spaced them out .25in between each other. The top overhangs about 2in on each side and about a half inch on the front and back. After assembling everything with screws, the bench was mostly complete.

The most challenging part for me was adding the diagonal braces. I was able to get the angle on the on the leg brace easily but I didn't angle it high enough to get full contact on the part that connects to the under side of bench. If I had to do it again, I think it would be much easier to cut now that I know what to do. What made it difficult is that my miter saw only goes to about 50 degrees, so I had to cut a jig to be able to cut high angles.

Overall, I am happy with how this turned out and it only took about 1 day to complete.
