description: A list of lower cost items that improve the quality of life of living in your home
---

Everyone wants to get the most value our of their home the cheapest way possible but I am more concerned with the quality of life instead. Here I'll list out some items I have purchased/acquired over the years that were not too expensive that I believe have substantially increased the quality of life (QoL) of living in my home. The following items are in no particular order.

## Cellular Shades

Swapping out vinyl blinds for cellular shades was one of the best decisions I have made as a home owner. Not only are they better looking but they are much easier to open and close. You can buy them in blackout if you wanted as well. These shades go for about $45 a piece so depending on how many windows you want to swap out it can get expensive, but if you spread it out over time its not too bad.

## Outdoor Cameras

Having a pair of security cameras has been great for peace of mind. These can get super expensive but you can also find cheaper versions on Amazon. My brother gave me the Eufy cam pro 2 cameras so I did not have to spend a dime. If you do not want to purchase a full set of cameras, at the very least get a camera doorbell. Having these things has been awesome for checking the live weather at home when Im away, checking where packages were left, if the trash came, etc. It's just been super nice to have a live view of the house on my phone.

## Door Knobs and Handles

  <figcaption class="text-center">Door Knob</figcaption>

When we moved in, all our door knobs were worn out bronze and they were in poor condition. We swapped them out for a brushed nickel finish and replaced all our exterior doors, excluding the front door, with handles instead of knobs. This is so if our hands are full we can easily open the door still. Honestly, if I wanted to spend more Id replace all the knobs with handles but it would be too expensive. Regardless, replacing the knobs helped a ton not only with the looks but with the smoothness of the doors opening/closing.

## Garage Fridge

The first thing I did when I bought my truck was go on Facebook marketplace and look for a fridge to put in our garage. This has become one of the best purchases I have made for the house. Being able to move all of our drinks out of the kitchen fridge and into the garage has freed up so much space for other things and makes it so much easier to find. Assuming you go about it the same way I did, you can get a used fridge for < $150. This is definitely a must have if you have the space in your garage and have the drinks/food to fill it. I would highly recommend getting one with a decent sized freezer too. I have ended up using that freezer side for things like frozen pizzas, ice, and long-term frozen meat.

## New Smoke Detectors

  <figcaption class="text-center">Front loader smoke detector</figcaption>
</figure>

You are supposed to replace your smoke detectors every 10 years and I recently replaced all mine in the house as they were 12 years old. Mine are hardwired so I needed to get a set that supported that as well as had a battery backup in case the power were to go out. I found some on Amazon with both of those requirements and it turns out these have a front-load battery door. This is super nice as I can replace the battery without even taking the smoke detector down, I just simply open the door, swap it out, and close it. For a pack of 6, these were only $65. You can also get smoke detectors from your local fire station, but I wasn't sure what kind they'd give me so I just bought my own. They also make some that are CO and Smoke detectors, so if you have gas in your house that may be a good idea.

## Ceiling Lighting

  <figcaption class="text-center">Ceiling Fan</figcaption>
</figure>

When touring our home prior to purchasing, we noticed that a lot of rooms did not have ceiling lights. This was super confusing for us and we did not understand how the previous owners were able to live like that. Therefore, prior to moving in, we had an electrician come out and install a ceiling fan in the bedroom and the office, and install some wafer lights in the living room. This was not super cheap however the QoL improved drastically. Having ample lighting in the living room was a must and we even added a dimmer to the switch later on so we could watch movies with the light on. Having the ceiling fans in the rooms was also required as we live in a 2-story home so it can get warm upstairs. This was a top 2 priority upon purchasing our home, so this needed to get done.

## Closet Shelving

  <figcaption class="text-center">Closet Shelves</figcaption>
</figure>

Prior to moving into our home, we lived in a nice apartment that had a decent sized master bedroom closet. This closet had 2 sets of wire shelving that gave us plenty of storage space. However, in our house the master bedroom closet only had 1 set of shelves. Therefore, shortly after moving in we bought another set of shelves, moved our current ones up about a foot and a half, and put the new shelves below the old ones. This gave us a substantial amount more of storage and hanging space than we previously had. Adding these shelves made you wonder how the previous owners were able to fit everything in there previously, it just didn't seem possible. These shelves are not very expensive so it felt like a no-brainer.

## Laundry Room Shelving

  <figcaption class="text-center">Laundry Room Shelves</figcaption>
</figure>

I built some shelves for our laundry room that we desperately needed, as pictured above. Previously, we just had two very small wire baskets on each side that we're falling out of the wall. I ended up making these out of 1x10 quality pine boards and shelf brackets. I stained them and added a top coat as well. They turned out really good and I am super happy with them in both how they look and how the function. These shelves allowed us to store additional items we had tucked away in a closet, like light bulbs, candles, and trash bags. These shelves also allowed us to move the detergent from on top of the dryer to its own spot on the shelf next to the washer, which let us dispense it easier. This only cost me about $50-60 to build so they were definitely worth it.

## Water Leak Sensors

</figure>

I purchased these Govee water leak sensors shortly after moving into our home. These are great for peace of mind and allow you to get notified if a leak occurs both by phone and by audible sound. You can get a pack of 6 and a home base for $65 and the batteries last a long time. These have helped me identify leaks quickly and have saved my butt multiple times from a leaky sink. I definitely recommend getting something similar to these, they work great and are not too expensive for the peace of mind they give. You can find the sensors [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J9HZ5VN?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&th=1).

## Soft Close Toilet Seats

  <figcaption class="text-center">Soft Close Toilet Seat</figcaption>
</figure>

My wife grew up with every toilet having a soft close toilet seat and so when we moved in and the seats were not soft close, she knew we had an immediate problem. Replacing all the seats with soft close has been super nice as we always close the lids completely so our cat does not get in the toilet and thus having it close softly is just a nice convenience factor for us. I did have to replace one of these already as the hinge busted but every other seat has held up thus far. These are not very expensive, maybe like $15 a seat so it is definitely a simple and low-cost upgrade.

## Garage Storage Cabinet

  <figcaption class="text-center">Garage Storage Cabinet</figcaption>
</figure>

My wife and I have a decent sized kitchen but we had some rarely used, small appliances that would take up valuable space in the house. My solution to this problem was to buy a steel cabinet for the garage to put all of our extra stuff in and free up space in the kitchen. This has actually been super nice to have as we do not use the items in the cabinet frequently and so we are now able to put other items in their place that we use a lot more. Overall, this just improved our kitchen organization and our ability to find items we need. This cabinet was less than $175 so it was not very expensive either. You can find the cabinet I bought [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV4VC6TF?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1).

## Motion Sensor Patio Lights

<figure>

  <figcaption class="text-center">Motion Sensor Patio Lights</figcaption>
</figure>

I replaced our patio lights on the front and back of the house with some motion sensor ones. I noticed that when people would leave the house at night, if we didn't intentionally turn the light on, it was too dark for them to see safely and thus I felt having these would help improve that. These were super easy to install and work great. You just leave your switch in the on position and set the setting to be either on or only turn on with motion. For the front, it dimly turns on automatically at dusk and if there is motion it goes to 100% brightness. For the back, it only turns on if there is motion after dusk. These lights were less than $100 and they look quite nice too, so I think they were worth the investment. You can find the ones I bought [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C65FSRHX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1).

## Automatic Soap Dispenser

  <figcaption class="text-center">Automatic Soap Dispenser</figcaption>
</figure>

In the kitchen, we added an automatic soap dispenser by the sink so if our hands are dirty (e.g. from touching raw meat) we can get soap without touching the soap dispenser. This has come in handy numerous times and is now a must-have for us. You can control how much soap comes out by how close you are to the nozzle. The particular one we got is a little pricey (~$70) but I am sure you can get something similar for cheaper. I do not think you need this for every sink, but I do think you should get it for the kitchen sink. You can find the dispenser I bought [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVNGWWX6?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&th=1).

## Handheld Vacuum

  <figcaption class="text-center">Handheld Vacuum</figcaption>
</figure>

A little handheld vacuum is super nice to have for small spills or messes around the house. Instead of lugging around the big vacuum and dealing with the cord, this little vacuum is rechargeable and is lightweight. We mainly use this for quick cleans and vacuuming the couch or other seats. This particular model lets you suck up liquids too, so if you spill something you can use this instead of a paper towel if you choose. You can find these type of vacuums for super cheap, I bought this one for $45.
