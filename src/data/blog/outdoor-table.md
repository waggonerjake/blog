description: A simple, 1 day outdoor coffee table build

While I was out on paternity leave, I built a coffee table using some left cedar my neighbor gave to me that was used for a pergola.

## Inspiration

I have been wanting to do something like this for a very long time, but things just never lined up and I did not have the tools (pocket screws) until just recent. I followed the video below to create this table. I did not follow all the steps as I do not have a planer nor did I sand the wood. The cedar I had was already stained so I did not need to do any finishing at all. I built it using the same dimensions as the video and followed the same techniques.

## Materials & Assembly

Since this was made out of cedar that was given to me, I had to use what I had. I had no 2x4s but rather had 2x6s, so I ripped them in half and used that as a substitute for the 2x4 legs, stretchers, and supports. This table ended up being 2ft wide by 4ft long and 15in tall. The bottom leg supports are screwed together with pocket screws on the under side so you cannot see them. For the top supports and stretchers, they are screwed on the top so you cant see them as well. For the table top, I used some 1x6s and 1 1x8 that I ripped to be 1x6. To attach them to the frame, I used wood glue.

Once assembled, I let it sit to cure for 24hrs then I put it out on my deck. It rained the next day and that let me see where there was any squeeze out from the glue that I missed to scrape off. Once identified, I grabbed my scrapper and went at it. This wa the result of assembly before cleaning off any squeeze out.

Overall, I am quite happy with this table and it was super easy to build. Its lightweight and looks nice, and its big enough to be useful but small enough to not take up too much space. One thing to note is that you **must** use outdoor rated pocket screws if you are going to do this.
