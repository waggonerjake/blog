description: A DIY cabinet used as a charging station and storage
---

After building my workbench, I decided I needed somewhere to store my drills and other battery accessories + some other things. I saw some drill charging stations online and thought those were pretty cool so I decided to go that route. My father-in-law gave me a large power strip so I knew I wanted to incorporate that in my build.

## Materials & Assembly

This whole thing is built out of 3/4" plywood sheathing. I also put some edge banding on the the exposed edge on the front just for fun. This cabinet is ~3ft x ~3.5 ft and is held together with glue and screws. For the bottom shelf, I cut the divider short so that the power strip could fit in the back of the space. I also had to cut a hole in the side so the plug for the strip can be plugged into the wall. For the remaining shelves, I used dados to support them and they are just floating, they are not glued or screwed in.

Assembling the dividers was took a little trial and error. Firstly, I attached the bottom one by driving screws from the bottom of the cabinet and the top of the shelf above it into the end grain of the divider. Then, I attached the top divider using the same technique. For the middle, I could not do this as the top and bottom shelves were now blocked by the other dividers, so I instead screwed it in from the back and used a small drill bit to find the divider from the back of the cabinet.

Before cutting the cabinet shelf dados, I scoped out what section would hold what so I knew what size to make it. The following is how I currently have it setup:

- Bottom right: Batteries
- Bottom left: Bits (Router, Drill, etc.) and Drill Accessories
- Middle Right: Drills, Nailer, Battery Tools
- Middle left: Fasteners
- Top, Bottom Right: Misc/Random
- Top, Top Right: Black and Decker Matrix Tool Box
- Top Left: Sander/Dremel and Sanding Discs

At some point, I need to make some holders for my fasteners instead of just using a Menards bag. I also need to make a holder for my sanding discs.

## Hanging

This cabinet weighs a ton, even when its empty, due to it being made out of 3/4" ply. Therefore, I needed a nice sturdy way to hold this cabinet up on the wall. I thought about just screwing it directly to the studs but I was worried that, due to the weight, the screws may snap due to the weight being centered on the screws only. Thus I decided to use a cleat system to hold this cabinet up. This cabinet has a dual cleat setup that is secured to two wall studs using 4 3" screws. The cleats allow the weight to span across the cleat rather than be centered on the screws. I attached the first cleat to the top of the cabinet, held the cabinet up, and marked where the wall cleat should go. I think installed it on the wall and that was the first one done.

The second cleat was a lot more challenging. First, I attached the cleat to the wall. Now I had to figure out where to put the cleat on the cabinet so that it would fit perfectly and not miss the cleat entirely or make it bump out. To do this, I put the cabinet back on the top cleat so it would hang on the wall and touch the bottom cleat too. I think shoved the cleat that I would be attaching to my cabinet inside the bottom wall cleat so it would seem as if it were attached. I then marked where the cleat sat with a pencil and knew thats where it needed to be screwed in. I took the cabinet back down, screwed in the cleat, and hung it back up for the final time. It ended up working perfectly.

One thing to note is that the studs are spaced a little off from where I wanted this cabinet, so the cleats on the cabinet hang over the cleats on the wall a bit. This is fine, it just looks a little strange. Below you can see the cleats I installed (You can still see the mark I made on the cabinet side for the bottom cleat)
