description: Build process for a set of small barn doors I built for our board game cubby
---

When we moved into our house we had these cutouts in the living room that I assume were for the TV and other electronics, however we repurposed them as a decor space and a board game storage area. For the board games, my wife wanted to add a small set of barn doors in front of the cubby to give it some personality, so I was tasked with my building them.

## Materials, Building, and Assembly.

Building these was not too difficult however this was one of the very first DIY project I hade done since we moved in, so it took quite a bit of time and effort. The space these barn doors are used in is not very large, so we were able to buy 3/4" 2' x 4' oak Veneer handipanels for the door bodies and then for the accent pieces I used 1/4" oak veneer plywood. I assembled them using wood glue. Here is a photo of the space before I added the barn doors:

We wanted to put the barn doors in front of the board games in the bottom cubby. I took some measurements of the space, attached the barn door track, [which can be found on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/FREDBECK-Cabinet-Bypass-Hrdware-Hardware/dp/B0B2DBN3MK/ref=sr_1_4_sspa?crid=3LCK8Q63GGW77&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9._4uTxZz9ipJLl4wTBElSZ-nkt2SUlK28x8Adds8MZwk209_dzMyrB2dGIQLsf7mYtoiTfit6RQIJkNYh1DB7Qka6ptlQFeu9qsEVsRfMmaNSXISrA2kAB43zWrCHzplE7OExKuE5gDSK8LRBU9-BsuBw-i9gvdF2imNF0r_u5mX4j_jv9E7AJdSUGTd5ETiMqy7is3-alhSrq3BUmAF0lqwcC19hSgH7OtfMVmZZRVhVRAtBXrf5qmMCru9PYeWugYjh7fxyMPI2moIoyaRvcwn8mtjbq8P-ZYzxL2cDBBg.w8cRTC_i9_tcyjIt2yBpfshL66MX7XgL1N_8Vz2spMw&dib_tag=se&keywords=fredbeck%2Bbarn%2Bdoor%2Bmini%2B4ft&qid=1754100009&sprefix=fredbeck%2Bbarn%2Bdoor%2Bmini%2B4ft%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-4-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1), and cut the plywood base to do a dry fit. This is how it was going to roughly look:

Once I confirmed these were the correct size, I cut the accent pieces to size and glued them on the base. After assembly, this is how they turned out:

These actually turned out really well and I was super happy with it. As shown, the bottom and top pieces are thicker than the side and middle pieces to give it a nice paneling look. This took careful measuring as to make sure the two door panels were equal in size. I really liked the grain pattern of these too, however I ended up ruining during the finishing process.

## Finishing

Originally, I wanted to stain these doors a nice dark brown. I watched quite a few YouTube videos on the proper way to stain so I felt like I was ready. As I stated earlier, this was one of the first projects I did so I did not have much experience at all. I was not even aware that this was plywood until after the fact, I thought these were solid oak panels (how naive ðŸ˜«). I purchased pre-stain condition, the dark stain I wanted, and a bunch of sandpaper for a sheet sander I borrowed from my dad. In the videos I watched, I was told to sand the wood with 120, 150, 180, and 220. This took forever and was very tedious, especially because I had already assembled. I used the pencil method to know when I was done sanding so at least I had that.

What I was not aware of was that these panels were already sanded smooth and ready to go. And since I thought this was solid oak, I was not careful while sanding, I simply followed the video I watched. After going through all 4 grits on all sides on both doors, I was finally ready to begin staining. I applied the pre-stain condition and then the stain itself. Below is how the front turned out:

I actually really liked the color of this stain on the wood and thought the grain pattern looked nice too. However, I noticed there were a couple dark spots on the wood that seemed odd. Since this is plywood with a very thin oak veneer, it is possible to stand through that veneer to expose the under layers of plywood. This is exactly what I ended up doing on the spots highlighted below:

Unfortunately, this happened on both doors, not just isolated to one. What's interesting is that the back side of the doors turned out completely fine, I was even able to add a polyurethane top coat to them.

After some back and forth with my wife, we decided it would be best to just paint over the failed stain instead of scrapping everything and starting over. We picked a nice dark brown from Benjamin Moore to paint over these. I used a spray Bulls Eye primer first and then I applied the paint to the door, then applied a water based polycrylic finished that is good for interior use as it does not have such a strong smell and wont leave a yellow tint to the paint. I would have definitely preferred these to be stained, but at least I did not have to start from scratch. In the end, this is how the doors turned out:

It still looks nice but the grain pattern I liked is now hidden for the most part. In the future, I know this does not need to be sanded at all and can be stained right away. I also know that its plywood and thus would use some type of edge banding along the sides to cover the plywood layers.

## Hanging

There isn't much to say on the hanging portion of these, you simply just screw in the door pieces according to the manufacturer's instructions. I did have to do a slight modification to the way they move. Due to the way the door track is, you put the outside door in front of the floor guide which means it rests on it. This was an issue because 1.) It would scratch the door and 2.) it would make a terrible noise. To solve this, I attached a felt pad to the floor guide which mitigated both of these and has worked to this day, over 2 years later.
