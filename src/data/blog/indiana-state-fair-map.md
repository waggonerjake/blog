description: Showing my custom Google map of the 2023 Indiana State Fair food vendors
---

Below you can find a custom google map I made to be used when at the Indiana state fair. This map shows what food vendors are where and has a little picture with a description. The point of this is for me and others to be able to find their favorite vendor quickly so they can stop by them first before they fill up on other vendors. Ideally this would get updated every year but its just too much work for me alone to support. Taking the pictures and filling out the map in real-time takes around 8 hours and I just don't have the time to dedicate to doing this. I used to have a website dedicated to this map with the ambition of adding more maps for more festivals (e.g. Farmers Markets, christkindlmarkt , etc.) but again, doing it myself is just not possible given the time it takes to make the map.

Good news is the vendors at the state fair do not change that frequently so this map is still pretty accurate. The map is from 2023 but in 2024 and 2025 it was still useful, so I figured Id share it here to be used by others.
