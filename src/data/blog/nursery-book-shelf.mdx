description: Showing off the book shelves I made for our son's nursery

Bookshelves are a classic staple of any nursery and make introducing books to your child more convenient. For our baby shower, we asked our guests to bring a favorite book from their childhood and so we got over 20 books that we now had to display. Detailed below is how I built some shelves for our son's nursery to display his new books.

## Inspiration

My wife wanted to have some bookshelves in our son's room and thus began looking for a design/style she liked. She came across [these](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1503480887/nursery-shelves-nursery-bookshelf-wall) on Etsy and really like the look of them. However, these were quite expensive for the dimensions we want ($65 a shelf üò®) thus I was tasked with building our own. I really liked the unfinished look as it looks more childish than a stained set so it fits a kids room. The shelves could've been painted but again, I liked the unfinished look the most.

## Materials and Dimensions

I built three shelves total, at 3 ft long, 3.5in deep, and 6in tall. I chose these dimensions for 3 reasons:

- 3ft: It filled the space nicely and since we have so many books this would hold them all with a little space to grow
- 3.5in: This would allow us to stack 2-3 books in front of each other on average thus allowing us to store more books
- 6in: Some books we got our quite tall, so we needed the dowel in the front to be high enough to support the tall books from falling over all while not being too tall to let our smallest book fall through.

The wood I used was quality, solid pine for the shelf body and then some dowels for the top support. The exact specs are as follows:

- 2: 8ft, 1in x 4in boards (Sides, Base)
- 3: 4ft, .5in diameter dowels (Top support)

Buying a 4in wide board meant I did not have to make any rip cuts to get it to the depth I want, so that was nice. I chose .5in dowels because I needed a decent thickness but nothing too bulky, so this fit that perfectly. I also had to buy a router bit to cut keyholes as well as some drywall anchors and a keyhole hanging kit (more on that [here](https://www.jakewaggoner.com/posts/diy-hook-shelf#hanging)). Altogether, this build cost me about $50 for all 3 shelves.

## Cutting

I decided to connect the sides and base together using a half lap joint rather than a regular butt joint. This was done because I wanted to assembly this using wood glue and brad nails and thus this type of joint allows for more glue surface area thus creating a stronger bond than a standard butt joint. Therefore, I had to take that into account when making the cuts. I wanted the whole shelf to be 3ft in length, so I cut the 3 base pieces at 3ft. For the height, I wanted 6in total so I cut the side pieces at 5 5/8in to account for the half lap. Each half lap was cut at half the board thickness down and half the board thickness in (this would be 3/8in). I cut this using my table saw by just doing multiple passes and then cleaning it up with a chisel. Making the half laps was the most time consuming cutting of this entire build, everything else was just simple cross cuts. My joints aren't perfect but this was good practice for me.

I waited to cut the dowels until I started assembly, however I did cut the holes during this phase. To do this, I measured .5in from the top and .5in from the front of each side piece. This is is going to be the center of the dowel and since each dowel is .5in in diameter, this would give me .25in of clearance on the top and front. I used a .5in spade bit to cut the holes with my drill. One nice trick to get clean holes with a spade bit is to drill the hole most of the way from one side, then flip the board over and drill the rest of it. This will prevent tear out and create a nicer looking hole.

## Keyhole routing

To hang these shelves, I used a [keyhole router bit](https://www.menards.com/main/tools/power-tool-accessories/router-bits-accessories/cmt-contractor-trade-3-8-keyhole-router-bit/85001/p-1444426666003-c-10080.htm?exp=false) to cut out keyholes in the side pieces for the screws to sit in. To cut these easily, I clamped all the side pieces together side by side to make one uniform piece so my router could sit on it as flat as possible. Since I do not have a plunge router, I had to drill my holes with my drill first. To do this in a repeatable pattern, I used a [drill block](https://www.menards.com/main/tools/power-tool-accessories/drill-attachments/milescraft-reg-drillblock-trade-hand-held-drill-guide/13170203/p-1537424882435-c-10155.htm?exp=false) and a [drill depth stop](https://www.menards.com/main/tools/power-tool-accessories/drill-bits-accessories/tool-shop-reg-drill-bit-stop-set-7-piece/75111/p-1642874311592276-c-10079.htm?exp=false) to make sure they were straight down and the same depth. These holes were drilled about 2.5in from the top, and I added a line about 1.5in from the top so I knew where my router needs to stop. Therefore, once all the holes were drilled I used my router to go from the hole to the line I drew for each piece.

> Note: When doing this, make sure you separate your side pieces into equal groups of left and right side pieces. If you fail to do this you will end up with unequal amounts of side pieces with keyholes and have to re-cut some pieces. Don't ask how I know üòÅ

## Assembly

To assemble these, I glued the half lap joints and clamped them together. I also shot a couple brad nails into each from the bottom. Once the shelf body was glued and nailed, I put glue in the holes where the dowel was going and pulled the dowel in the holes. Once the dowel was lined up I used a [flush cut saw](https://www.menards.com/main/tools/hand-tools/hand-saws-saw-blades/irwin-reg-7-3-4-plastic-handle-dovetail-hand-saw/2011491/p-1534228089619-c-9123.htm?exp=false) to cut the dowel flush with the sides. Once that was done all that was left was to wait for the glue to cure and then hang them using anchors and the keyhole kit. To learn how to use the keyhole kit, check out the my [hook shelf post](https://www.jakewaggoner.com/posts/diy-hook-shelf#hanging).
