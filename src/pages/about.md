![Myself](public/assets/myself.jpg)

Hello! I am Jake Waggoner and welcome to my blog! This is a space I created to allow me to share my own thoughts, opinions, things I'm actively doing, and any life updates. I live in Indiana, am married to a wonderful woman named Mercedes, have a son named Wesley, and a tuxedo cat named Samp.

I am currently a senior software engineer and have been in the industry since 2019. I started off as an intern at Ontario Systems (now called Finvi) and then once I graduated college in 2021 I joined DMI (now part of Encora) as a consultant and have been there ever since. My work includes migrating legacy APIs and creating new ones at Volkswagen Credit and migrating Heroku sites to AWS at Eli Lilly.

My wife and I bought our home in 2023, and ever since, I have always been busy either adding something new, fixing something broken, or adjusting something out of place to make our lives more comfortable; so expect to see a lot of DIY/woodworking posts on this site. I also plan on adding technical think pieces, opinions, and tips I have gathered throughout the years as well as general life updates/topics.
